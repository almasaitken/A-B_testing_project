# A-B_testing_project

Educational project on A/B testing given by Datacamp. 

The purpose of the project is to perform an A/B test for the mobile game. The hypothesis is that if a buying option (gate) to continue the game is offered at the earlier game level (30) than at the later level (40), the retention will be higher. 

The test showed a difference between the gates and the null hypothesis was rejected.
